Project Name
Project Description

This project provides a user authentication system with a login and signup page. It allows users to create accounts and log in securely, with additional protections to ensure password security and session management. This can be integrated into various applications to handle user access control.
Project Details

The project includes:

    Signup Page: New users can register by entering required details like username, password, and email. The password is encrypted for security.
    Login Page: Registered users can access their accounts by entering their username and password. On successful login, users receive an authentication token to manage their session.
    Profile Page (Optional): Authenticated users can view their profile details after logging in, demonstrating how protected routes work.
    Error Handling: Provides clear feedback if login or signup fails (e.g., incorrect password, user not found).
    Security: Passwords are encrypted before storage, and sessions or tokens are managed for secure authentication.
    Database Connection: All user information is stored securely in a database, with queries set up to handle user creation and login verification.

Example Usage

    Signup:
        Endpoint: POST /signup
        Request body example:

    {
      "username": "exampleUser",
      "email": "example@example.com",
      "password": "securePassword123"
    }

    Response:
        Success: User is created, and a success message is returned.
        Failure: Appropriate error message (e.g., "Email already exists").

Login:

    Endpoint: POST /login
    Request body example:

    {
      "email": "example@example.com",
      "password": "securePassword123"
    }

    Response:
        Success: Authentication token is generated and returned for session management.
        Failure: Error message for incorrect credentials.

Accessing Protected Routes:

    After logging in, users can access protected routes by including their authentication token in the request headers.
    Example for accessing profile data:

        GET /profile
        Authorization: Bearer your-authentication-token

Tools and Technologies

    Frontend: HTML, CSS, JavaScript (Optionally: React, Angular, etc.)
    Backend: Node.js, Express.js for handling server logic and API endpoints
    Database: MongoDB (or another database, depending on the project requirements)
    Authentication: JSON Web Tokens (JWT) or session-based authentication
    Encryption: bcrypt (or similar library) for hashing passwords before storing them in the database
    Environment Configuration: dotenv for managing environment variables securely (e.g., database URL, JWT secret)
